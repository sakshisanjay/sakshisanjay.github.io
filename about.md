## About Me

<br/>
My name is **Sakshi Sanjay Mehta**. I am working as a **Quality Assurance Engineer** at [Suyati Technologies, Kochi](https://suyati.com/).

### Background

I did my bachelors in Hotel Management and Tourism Studies from the [Oberoi Group of Hotels & Resorts](https://www.oberoihotels.com/) and [IGNOU](http://www.ignou.ac.in/). I have worked in Hotel Indutry for **5 years** in the following properties.

- [Trident Hotels, Agra](https://www.tridenthotels.com/hotels-in-agra/hotel-location)
- [Oberoi Bangalore](https://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-bengaluru/)
- [JW Marriott, Bangalore](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/blrjw-jw-marriott-hotel-bengaluru/)

My specialization in Hotel Industry was in **Guest Relations** and enjoyed working there each and every moment. The definition of **Quality** in hotel industry made me so much obsessed with giving the finest customer experience to every guest who choose our property.

- Ensuring all the wishes of the guest be fulfilled
- Ensuring that even the smallest gesture gives him/her happiness and satistfaction throughout their stay
- Making sure internal operations were precise when we handover to the next person on shift
- Ensuring that data driven decisions are made
- Ensuring that even employee satisfaction is of utmost importance from a customer experience standpoint

### Change in my career

I got married in 2015 to [Abhishek Sivasubramanian](https://abhisheksubbu.github.io) and shifted to Kochi, Kerala. I had to leave my job at JW Marriott, Bangalore due to relocation. In kochi, I have worked for Rajagiri Hospital as a Guest Relation Executive.

Soon, I got an offer from [Suyati Technologies, Kochi](https://suyati.com/) to join their Quality Team to help them improve quality of softwares that they develop for their customers. I was happy to see that my experience in Hotel Industry and a strong knowledge in customer experience was of great help in shining in the new career.

Now, I have officially shifted from Hospitality Industry to IT Industry. No looking back (even though I miss the hospitality environment).

### What do I do in my current role

I work with projects as a **Manual Tester** and **Automation Tester** using Selenium [.NET Platform].

#### Strong Areas

- Testing Salesforce CRM [Sales Cloud] implementations
- Testing Wordpress websites & plugins
- Responsive Testing using physical devices & BrowserStack
