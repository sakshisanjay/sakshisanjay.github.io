<p><br />
My name is <strong>Sakshi Sanjay Mehta</strong>. I am working as a <strong>Quality Assurance Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://suyati.com/">Suyati Technologies, Kochi</a>.</p>

<p>I did my bachelors in Hotel Management and Tourism Studies from the <a href="https://www.oberoihotels.com/">Oberoi Group of Hotels &amp; Resorts</a> and <a href="http://www.ignou.ac.in/">IGNOU</a>. I have worked in Hotel Indutry for <strong>5 years</strong> in the following properties.</p>

</ul>

<p>My specialization in Hotel Industry was in <strong>Guest Relations</strong> and enjoyed working there each and every moment. The definition of <strong>Quality</strong> in hotel industry made me so much obsessed with giving the finest customer experience to every guest who choose our property.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring all the wishes of the guest be fulfilled</li>
  <li>Ensuring that even the smallest gesture gives him/her happiness and satistfaction throughout their stay</li>
  <li>Making sure internal operations were precise when we handover to the next person on shift</li>
  <li>Ensuring that data driven decisions are made</li>
  <li>Ensuring that even employee satisfaction is of utmost importance from a customer experience standpoint</li>
</ul>

<p>I got married in 2015 to <a href="https://abhisheksubbu.github.io">Abhishek Sivasubramanian</a> and shifted to Kochi, Kerala. I had to leave my job at JW Marriott due to relocation. In kochi, I worked for Rajagiri Hospital as a Guest Relation Executive.</p>

<p>Soon, I got an offer from <a href="https://suyati.com/">Suyati Technologies, Kochi</a> to join their Quality Team to help them improve quality of softwares that we develop for their customers. I was happy to see that my experience in Hotel Industry and a strong knowledge in customer experience was of great help in shining in the new career.</p>
